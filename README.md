* Allow users to not see some types of posts in their dashboard. (opt out)

* Max amount of posts types that can be filterd = 3

* Don't just limit it to the dashboard?


Premium users:

* Not limited to filtering to 3 post types
* Can select specific blogs to have special permissions 

e.g.

- blog x doesn't have their posts filtered at all because I like them and I can rely on them not to post shit pics/videos

- always filter blog x's videos because they suck or always filter their quotes because they are too edgy 

* have a bin so users can see posts they have missed - ones that have been filtered
