Premium users??

Can select specific blogs to have special permissions 

e.g.

* blog x doesn't have their posts filtered at all because I like them and I can rely on them not to post shit pics/videos

* always filter blog x's videos because they suck or always filter their quotes because they are too edgy 

* have a bin so users can see posts they have missed - ones that have been filtered
